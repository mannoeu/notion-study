# Notion Study

This is a repository containing a study code for a basic clone of the "Notion" application. The goal of this project is to demonstrate the usage of the `@tiptap` library along with some extensions to create a similar functionality to Notion.

## Description

Notion is a popular tool for organization and collaboration, allowing users to create notes, documents, databases, and more. In this study project, we use the `@tiptap` library to create a basic Notion clone with essential functionalities.

`@tiptap` is a rich-text editor for the web built with Vue.js. It provides a flexible and easy-to-use API for creating and customizing text editors. In this project, we explore some popular extensions of `@tiptap` to add functionalities such as text formatting, list creation, table creation, etc.

## Features

The basic Notion clone in this project includes the following features:

- Text editing: allows users to write and format text with styles like bold, italic, code, headings levels etc.
- List creation: users can create ordered and unordered lists.
- Floating menu: a menu bar that appears near the selected text, providing formatting options.
- Bubble menu: a menu that appears when the user selects a block element, offering block-specific options.
